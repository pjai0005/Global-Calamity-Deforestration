The world seeks a high pace of climate change and global warming concerns for many reasons. One of them is the alarming rate of deforestation that happened within a century. Though some significant companies have moved towards eco-friendly models, that does not change the reality of the majority still not opting for a cleaner and healthier environment. One of the major problems is that they trade a lot of deforestation-related commodities between some countries according to domestic market demand. This reports shows some of the trends of Deforestation taking place in the world for two decades (1990 - 2020).


We have selected the data from the GitHub webpage of (TidyTuesday) [https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-04-06/readme.md], which talks about the drivers of deforestation over the years. We have chosen six datasets related to deforestation, and several variables are analyzed: forest area, deforestation, imported deforestation, exported deforestation, human food, animal food, processed, crop oil, and production. The data is originally obtained from “Our World in Data.” And this article “Forests and Deforestation” is retrieved from: ‘https://ourworldindata.org/forests-and-deforestation’ and written by Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser (2021).
